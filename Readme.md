ClickableLinksInChat
==============

A mod for Scrolls that allows you to click a link in the chat to open it in the default web browser. It's a bit rough, and has some non-obvious limitations.

* It needs to be higher priority than my other mod (UserMenuInChat) to work as intended
* It turns the entire message into a link, so if someone inserts two links you'll only be able to click the first (but you can click WELL outside that link if you want :P)
* It might be slow, due to Unity not supporting compiled regular expressions, but I haven't benchmarked it so I don't really know
